No, there is not a word count. Write enough so that you can explain your idea fully, but not so that it’s a full on dissertation. Be imaginative, and write about what you are passionate about, not necessarily what you think others may be. No rubric will be used, but responses will be judged based on originality and creativity—your imagination of novel perspectives and your passion for effecting positive change.
